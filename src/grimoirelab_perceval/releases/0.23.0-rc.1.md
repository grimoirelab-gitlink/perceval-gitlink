## perceval 0.23.0-rc.1 - (2023-10-19)

**New features:**

 * Jira authentication with token (#813)\
   Authentication in `jira` backend is supported using personal access
   tokens. Jira Core/Software (8.14 and later), Jira Service Management
   (4.15 and later) Data Center and server editions can use personal
   access tokens without a username. For Jira Cloud, username and token
   are required. Usage: perceval jira <YOUR_JIRA_SERVER> -u <USERNAME> -p
   <PASSWORD> perceval jira <YOUR_JIRA_SERVER> -t <PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN>
   perceval jira <YOUR_JIRA_CLOUD_SITE> -u <USERNAME> -t <TOKEN>
 * Clonfluence authentication with personal access tokens\
   Authentication in `confluence` backend is supported using personal
   access tokens. Confluence Data Center and server editions 7.9 and
   later can use personal access tokens without a username. For
   Confluence Cloud, username and token are required.

**Feature removals:**

 * Drop Python 3.7 support\
   Python 3.7 reaches the end of life in June 2023. This means it won't
   receive new updates or patches to fix security issues. Therefore, this
   package only works with Python >= 3.8 from now on.
